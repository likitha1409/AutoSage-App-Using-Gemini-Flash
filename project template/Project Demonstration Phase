Phase 7: Project Demonstration Phase
Execution Case: Demonstrated the app using a Honda VTX1300C.

The Workflow: 1.  Image uploaded successfully.
2.  System correctly identified the "1312cc Carbureted V-Twin" engine.
3.  System provided specific maintenance tips for the shaft drive.
4.  The "Buyer's Advice" section highlighted the bike’s reliability and custom variant features.

Conclusion: The demonstration successfully proved that AutoSage can deliver expert-level insights across all three required scenarios (Buying, Maintenance, and Eco-friendly choices).
