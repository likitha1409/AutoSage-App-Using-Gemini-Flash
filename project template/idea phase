Phase 1: Ideation Phase
Project Name: AutoSage AI – Multimodal Vehicle Intelligence.

Concept Statement: To bridge the gap between complex automotive engineering and the average consumer using "Zero-Shot" AI reasoning.

Problem Statement: Most vehicle owners and buyers lack the technical expertise to identify specific engine types, maintenance needs, or eco-efficiency just by looking at a vehicle.

Solution: A hardware-free, vision-based digital expert that uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to transform images into professional technical reports.

Target Personas: * Sarah (The Buyer): Needs a comparative edge when looking at used vehicles.

Alex (The Owner): Needs quick maintenance advice without reading a 500-page manual.

Emma (The Eco-User): Seeks to minimize environmental impact.
